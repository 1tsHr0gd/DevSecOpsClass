                          Insecure Direct Object Reference is a class of vulnerability where attackers are able to access pages they are not meant to have access to simply by changing parameter values. This attack results from a combination of insufficient access controls, and overly excessive client trust (excess/unneccesary request parameters).

                        Insecure Direct Object References can be found throughout the TaskManager source code. Straightforward examples can be found in most view functions that create, edit, or delete notes/tasks/projects. These view functions all fail to ensure the user is properly authorized to perform the action. You can find the appropriate functions labeled throughout the source code.

                         In each function that reads or writes from the database, validate the the user has the appropriate authorization and authentication to perform the action. Within django, there are some <a href="">useful functions</a> to ensure this, including
                         <pre>user.is_authenticated()</pre> and <pre>user.has_perm('permission_name')</pre>. django.nV exhibits this functionality in some of the view functions as well. <pre>manage_tasks</pre> and <pre>manage_projects</pre>

                         In general, user access must always be checked before any information can be added or changed in the database. Don't assume that just because a method is not linked, it won't be found!
