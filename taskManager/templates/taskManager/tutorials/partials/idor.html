                          Insecure Direct Object Reference is a class of vulnerability where attackers are able to access pages they are not meant to have access to simply by changing parameter values. This attack results from a combination of insufficient access controls, and overly excessive client trust (excess/unneccesary request parameters).

                        Insecure Direct Object References can be found throughout the TaskManager source code. Straightforward examples can be found in most view functions that create, edit, or delete notes/tasks/projects. These view functions all fail to ensure the user is properly authorized to perform the action. You can find the appropriate functions labeled throughout the source code.
                        <br /><br />
                        The example below is the method call for deleting tasks with an associated project. Note the lack of auth checks performed on the task_id before deleting the task.

                    <pre class="brush: python">

    proj = Project.objects.get(pk = project_id)
    task = Task.objects.get(pk = task_id)
    if proj != None:
        if task != None and task.project == proj:
            task.delete()

    return redirect('/taskManager/' + project_id + '/')

                         In each function that reads or writes from the database, validate the the user has the appropriate authorization and authentication to perform the action. Within django, there are some <a href="">useful functions</a> to ensure this, including
                         <i>user.is_authenticated()</i> and <i>user.has_perm('permission_name')</i>. django.nV exhibits this functionality in some of the view functions as well, including <i>manage_tasks</i> and <i>manage_projects</i>.
                         <br /><br />
                         In general, user access must always be checked before any information can be added or changed in the database. Don't assume that just because a method is not linked, it won't be found!

                         Try modifying ID values in requests made to the application. This is typically much easier to achieve using a client side proxy such as Burp Suite or Fiddler
                         especially with POST requests.
